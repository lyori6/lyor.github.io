                        "I worked with Lyor for nearly 4 years as a Product Design partner and his collaborative approach always showed he understood the importance of design in product development. He actively sought input from our team to ensure that UX considerations were integrated from the earliest stages of product conception. Lyor has shown outstanding leadership in advocating for user-centered design throughout the organization. He was instrumental in fostering a culture where consumer feedback is not just heard but is a key driver in decision-making processes and he was a valued member of the Voice of the Consumer committee. Lyor would be an asset to any team looking to enhance their product's usability. His dedication to crafting exceptional user experiences is evident in his approach to Product Management, and I am confident he will bring the same level of passion and expertise to whatever company he joins."
